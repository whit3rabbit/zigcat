The zigcat project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license, which can be found in the LICENSE-MIT file.

However, this project offers optional functionality that depends on third-party libraries with different licenses. When zigcat is compiled and distributed with certain dependencies, a different license may apply to the resulting binary.

- **Standard Build (with OpenSSL):**
  When built using the default TLS backend (OpenSSL), the project as a whole is licensed under the MIT license. OpenSSL itself is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

- **wolfSSL Build:**
  If you build zigcat with wolfSSL support (by using the `-Dtls-backend=wolfssl` build flag), the resulting binary is a derivative work of wolfSSL. Since wolfSSL is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2), any binary you create that includes wolfSSL must be licensed under the GPLv2. The text of this license is available in the LICENSE-GPLv2 file.

By choosing to build with wolfSSL, you agree to comply with the terms of the GPLv2 for the resulting work.

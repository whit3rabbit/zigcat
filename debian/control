Description: modern netcat clone written in Zig with TLS support
 Zigcat provides TCP and UDP client/server helpers, TLS/DTLS support, proxy
 awareness, GSocket NAT traversal, Telnet protocol support, and timeout-aware
 I/O in a compact standalone binary.
 .
 It aims to be a drop-in replacement for traditional netcat utilities while
 adding cross-platform features, security enhancements, and stricter error
 handling.
 .
 This package includes the OpenSSL-enabled dynamic binary with full TLS/DTLS
 and GSocket support.

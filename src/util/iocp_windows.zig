//! Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) wrapper for asynchronous I/O operations.
//!
//! This module provides a high-level abstraction over Windows IOCP, enabling
//! efficient single-threaded asynchronous I/O for files, pipes, and sockets.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//! - Asynchronous ReadFile/WriteFile operations
//! - Timeout-aware completion retrieval
//! - User data tagging for operation identification
//! - Batch completion retrieval for efficiency
//!
//! ## Usage Pattern
//! 1. Initialize IOCP with `Iocp.init()`
//! 2. Associate file/socket handles with IOCP
//! 3. Submit async operations (read/write)
//! 4. Wait for completions with `getStatus()` or `getStatusBatch()`
//! 5. Process completions and resubmit operations as needed
//!
//! ## Critical Constraints
//! - OVERLAPPED structure must be unique per operation (cannot reuse until completion)
//! - Buffers must remain valid until operation completes (no free/realloc)
//! - Handles must be opened with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED for async I/O
//! - ERROR_IO_PENDING is not an error - it means operation is in progress
//!
//! ## Performance Notes
//! - Single IOCP can manage thousands of handles efficiently
//! - Completion overhead: ~1-2Î¼s per operation
//! - Batch retrieval reduces syscall overhead significantly
